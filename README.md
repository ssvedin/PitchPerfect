Udacity Project: Pitch Perfect

Pitch Perfect is one of the Portfolio Apps for the iOS Developer Nanodegree from Udacity. It was created to provide an introduction to the iOS ecosystem, by using MVC design principles and the AVFoundation framework.

## The App
Pitch Perfect allows users to record their voice and will then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app will also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback, and experience fun echo and reverb effects.

## Requirements
This application was built using Xcode 10.1 and can be run on iOS 12.1 devices or simulators.
